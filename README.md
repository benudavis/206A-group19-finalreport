# instructions

The website pages can be edited at 'index.md' and at '/_pages/' + '--.md'. 

To add/remove pages from the top banner, visit '/_data/navigation.yml'. 

To change font settings, see '/_sass/minimal-mistakes/_variables.scss'. 

Theme and other settings can be changed in '/_config.yml'.

For full documentation, visit the [Minimal Mistakes website](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/).

There's a way to view the site locally, but I was too lazy to figure it out. Instead, I just push to github and reload the site (you have to wait for the action to complete).

**Note: Upload your headshot into /assets/media/ and update the filepath in team.md.**
